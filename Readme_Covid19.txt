COVID-19 Time Series Analysis
This project performs time series analysis on COVID-19 data to explore trends, forecast future cases, and analyze the impact of the virus over time. The analysis provides insights into the spread of the virus, peak periods, and trends in recovery and fatality rates. The project aims to aid in understanding and potentially predicting COVID-19 case trajectories over time.

Dataset Overview
The COVID-19 dataset used for this analysis contains daily records of case counts, including confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths. Data is organized by date, and may be segmented by country, region, or globally depending on the scope of analysis.

Key Columns
Date: The date of each record, representing the primary time series index for the analysis.
Country/Region: Country or region name where the data was recorded (optional for global analysis).
Confirmed: Cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases by date.
Deaths: Cumulative number of deaths by date.
Recovered: Cumulative number of recovered cases by date.
Active: Active cases (calculated as Confirmed - Deaths - Recovered, if not directly provided).
This structure allows for daily analysis of confirmed, recovered, and fatal cases over time, enabling forecasting and trend analysis.

Project Structure
data/: Contains the COVID-19 dataset files (e.g., covid19_data.csv).
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and time series modeling.
src/: Python scripts for data cleaning, processing, and time series model development.
README.md: Overview of the project and instructions.
requirements.txt: List of necessary Python packages for easy setup.

Analysis Workflow

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Handle missing values and ensure correct date formatting.
Aggregate data by date for regional or global analysis as required.
Generate any additional metrics, such as daily new cases or rolling averages.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize the daily trends of confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths.
Calculate and plot key metrics, such as recovery and fatality rates.
Identify trends, seasonal patterns, or anomalies in the data.
Time Series Modeling:

Decomposition: Decompose the time series data into trend, seasonality, and residual components.

Forecasting Models:
ARIMA/SARIMA: AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average models for univariate time series forecasting.
Prophet: Facebook's Prophet model for handling seasonality and trend analysis in time series data.

Visualization and Insights:
Generate plots for observed vs. forecasted values.
Visualize trend changes and make observations about the progression of the pandemic.
Highlight significant peaks, drops, and potential forecasts for future cases.
